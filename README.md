## Acknowledgment 
I was inspired after reading about the **10,000** hour rule in Malcolm Gladwell's *Outliers*. In his book, Gladwell says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. I wanted to create an application that can track these hours for those who seek to achieve success through constant hours of practice.

You should also check out his book, when you get the chance to.
